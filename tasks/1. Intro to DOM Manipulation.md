# Intro to DOM Manipulation

This is going to be a difficult task. I have created a starter-app which is engaging and dynamic but a little advanced. It will take some time to fully understand what is going on, but studying working code is an excellent way to learn. Here are some tips for trying to understand code when you see it for the first time:

* Read a small section of the code (3-5 lines at a time)
* Make note of any variables declared, along with their types
* Make assumptions about what the code does
* Test your assumptions using console.log



## Resources

Here are some resources that will help in trying to understand the example, feel free to read them before hand or simply use them as references as you try to complete the tasks:

## Tasks

* Answer all of the questions in the index.js file by copying the question into this file and then answering it as best you can.
* Implement methods 'walkNorth', 'walkSouth', and 'walkWest', using the existing method 'walkEast' as a guide
* What happens if you call 'walkNorth' and then immediately call 'walkSouth'?
* How can we prevent this behavior?
