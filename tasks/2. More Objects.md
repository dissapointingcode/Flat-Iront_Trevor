## Resources

Here are some resources that will help in trying to understand the example, feel free to read them before hand or simply use them as references as you try to complete the tasks:

## Tasks

* Go to the opengameart link above and select some images to add as new object to your game
* Create a function which accepts two DOM elements and return a boolean- `true` if they collide `false` if they don't.
* How could you implement a method which relies on the first, and iterates over all objects to see if any of them collide?
* How could you respond to the collision?
* How could Object Oriented and Event Based programming help solve these challenges?
